Sound Notifications: Get audio alerts for actions like starting, pausing, or finishing the process.
Exit Anytime: Ensures the program can be safely closed, even during execution.
Standalone Executable: The script can be converted to an .exe file with a custom icon for ease of use.
Usage:
Input: Provide a list of URLs in a .txt file.
Setup: Adjust the settings using the GUI to match your preferences.
Start: Launch the process and let the tool handle the rest.
